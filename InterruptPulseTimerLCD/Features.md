# Features and Settings: 

## User controls:
* **Signal amplifier:** Adjustable input signal amplification is set using 2 potentiometers on the signal conditioning board (middle). 
	* Stage 1 adjustment is found in the upper middle of the signal conditioning board. It is set once to establish the maximum output and resolution of stage 2. 
	* Stage 2 adjustment is located on the front left edge of the conditioning board. This controls the signal levels for the threshold comparators. 
* **Low pass filter:** The built in adjustable low pass filter makes signal measurement more reliable when 100% brightness cannot be used. Monitor settings below 100% brightness create high noise in the frame input signal. 
	*Located behind the stage 2 amplifier adjustment on the front left edge of the conditioning board. Should be set to minimum when using 100% brightness monitor settings. 
* **Button inputs:** Primary user inputs located on the top LCD board. 
	* Left/Right: Cycle through measurement display modes. 
	* Up/Down: Change settings and measurement output types within display modes. 
	* Select: Resets measurement counters in all modes. Also used to save setting changes when prompted for certain modes. 
	
	
## Display mode overview: 
* **Analog wave peak levels:** Minimum and maximum analog voltage levels of the signal. Useful for adjusting the amplifier and threshold settings.
	* **Wave Peak+:** Maximum signal level. Amplifier should be set with Peak+ between 850-900. 
	* **Wave Peak-:** Minimum signal level. Threshold should be approximately 1/4 total signal range above Peak-. 
* **PWM Threshold setting:** Output setting for digital trigger threshold with real time phase length display.
	* **Threshold:** Current threshold level setting. Up/Down to change level. Changes take effect immediately. 
	* **Phase mS:** Current threshold length measurement. Use to monitor effects of threshold setting changes and detect dimmer noise in the signal. 
* **Frame rate setting:**  For frame count calibration. Frame rate (refresh rate in Hz) of the monitor used for testing. 
	* **Set F rate:** Current setting will display when entering the mode. Up/Down to change setting. Changes will only take effect if you press [Select] before exiting mode. 
* **Target frame count setting:**  For frame count calibration. Goal number of ON frames per cycle currently being tested. 
	* **Set Goal F#:** Current setting will display when entering the mode. Up/Down to change setting. Changes will only take effect if you press [Select] before exiting mode.
